## 📘 Overview

HSIL (Human Semantic Intention Language) is an open, universal, machine-readable language for representing human intention.  
It provides a structured format that allows AI agents, robots, synthetic worlds, and intelligent systems to reason about what humans *mean*, not just what they *say*.

HSIL defines:

- 20 core Intent Elements  
- Formal syntax for Intent Expressions  
- Composite, conflicting, and blended intentions  
- Effective Intent Resolution  
- AI agent and multi-agent usage guidelines
